# VocaliseAnalysis
This is a project for the Audio and Music Processing Lab from the SMC master at UPF (Barcelona). The project is an analysis of the piece 'Vocalise' by Rachmaninoff and composition of new melodies based on this piece. 
You can find all the details about it in the project report: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-4eJZhSNcQ1UzVaOTBVdWdRODg/view?usp=sharing 

This repository contains all the code for the project, as well as most of the additional files that have been used. It's been developed mainly in Matlab using the midi toolbox.
